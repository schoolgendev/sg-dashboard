The structure of the SgStats object is as follows:

SgStats

 |--currentVisual
 |--general
 |      |---bestSch
 |      |       |----hour
 |      |       |----week

 |      |        `---total
 |       `---records
 |              |----total

 `--spec
       |----domain
       |----co2Saved
       |----dateString
        `---kwhGen


currentTimeDivs - this holds the current time divisions between the data points.
 The values are taken from the TimePeriod enum.

currentVisual - this holds the current TimePeriod type being displayed.

general - holds all the general information about the schoolgen programme. This includes the following

- bestSch - these are the best solar producing schools for different periods.
 SgStats.general.bestSch.hour holds the best school for the last hour.
 SgStats.general.bestSch.week holds the best school for the last week.
 SgStats.general.bestSch.year holds the best school for the last year.
 The schools are represented by the ID('id'), the name('name'), and the value ('val')

- egco2 - holds the amount of CO2 we've offset and the amount of energy we've produced.
 The time periods available are the following:
    - today - has today.co2 and today.energy as properties.
    co2 is measured in kg, while energy is measured here as watt-hours.
    - total - this is the total energy and co2 over the lifetime of the programme.

- records - holds the record day for the schoolgen programme. Note that this is contingent on
 all of the solar node devices at each school being powered and operational.
    - records.total holds the record day for the whole programme. It has two properties.
        - timestamp - a string representing the date of the programme
        - val - the amount of kilo-watt hours we generated that day
    - records.year holds data for the record day for the last twelve months.
        It has the same two properties that records.total has.

spec - holds all specific information about schoolgen programme, i.e. information
 pertainining to the currentVisual field
