SOLAR DASHBOARD

- sgComp holds the comparator objects
- sgComp.e = energy measured objects
- sgComp.w = weight measured objects

Comparators are in the format:

{
	obj: "batt-phone",
    val: 0.01,
    bg: "url('img/phone-wg-bg.png')",
    color: "#333333",
    lText: {
        smallprint: ""
    },
    rText: {
        up: "Could recharge",
        span: "",
        down: "smartphones!"
    },
    tooltip: "One smartphone takes 10 Watt-hours to fully charge."
    }
}

The fields are:
- obj: a name for the object. No spaces.
- val: how much kWh this object requires.
 Append "MULTIPLY-" at the front of the name - for multiplicative operations
(e.g. km driven by a train requires multiplying total kWh,
 compared to phone batteries charged, which requires dividing the total kWh)
- bg: the background for the slider.
 Backgrounds have dimensions of 360px x 160px.
 Specify the background using a string "url('img/your-img-here.png')"
- color: the color for the text that appears in that slide.
- lText.margin: holds the top and left margins.
 Specify in terms of pixels.
 Specify "null" for the default margin.
- rText.margin: holds the top and right margins.
- rText.up: holds the text above the number
- rText.span: holds the text after the number
- rText.down: holds the text below the number
 Use "" to not specify any of these texts.
- tooltip: holds the text that appears on hovering over the slider.
