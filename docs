GIT & GITHUB
- Git: an application running on your computer.
 Send commands to Git using your editor or the command line.
 You can do things like make a new repository, commit some code, etc.
- GitHub: a server that stores user's Git repositories.
- Really good resource:
 https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud
 (Atlassian makes BitBucket, a competitor to GitHub. The functionality is
  basically the same however.)

Getting started:
- Use 'git init' to start a project from scratch.
- Use 'git clone <https://remote-repository-URL>' to create a working
 copy of a project, being stored on a remote repository.

Both of these options will create a folder named .git in your repository.
This is where all the repository information exists.

At any time:
- Use 'git status' to see the status of your repository.
- This will typically show you:
    - what branch you are on
    - how your branch compares to a remote branch (e.g. the one you cloned from)
    - Whether or not you have changes in the repository and
    - Whether or not those changes have been staged

Staging and Committing:
- After making changes to a file in the repository, you can save the changes
 (e.g. click 'Save' or Ctrl+S in an editor)
- These changes are not yet added to the repository.
- To prepare changes you wish to make, you must STAGE them.

        STAGING PHASE
- Stage a file by using 'git add <file-name-here>'.
- To stage a change means to include that change in the next commit that you make.
 A modified file that has NOT been staged will not be included in the next commit.
 This way you can selectively commit files that are ready to be committed.
- To discard changes that are not yet staged for a specific file,
 use 'git checkout -- <file-name>'
- To discard changes that are not yet staged for the entire repo,
 use 'git checkout -- . '
 The filename '.' refers to the current directory - basically you are calling
 git checkout -- on the project (if you are on the root directory for the project).
- To unstage a staged commit, use git reset HEAD <file-name-here>.

        COMMIT PHASE
- To commmit your changes, use 'git commit -m "insert commit message here" '
- Commits are ATOMIC - if at some point along the way the commit fails,
 the entire commit is rolled back.
- Commit messages are supposed to be informative (but its entirely up to you what
 goes into the commit message).





SOLAR DASHBOARD

PAGECONTROLLER.JS

- sgComp holds the comparator objects
- sgComp.e = energy measured objects
- sgComp.w = weight measured objects

Comparators are in the format:

{
	obj: "batt-phone",
    val: 0.01,
    bg: "url('img/phone-wg-bg.png')",
    color: "#333333",
    lText: {
        smallprint: ""
    },
    rText: {
        up: "Could recharge",
        span: "",
        down: "smartphones!"
    },
    tooltip: "One smartphone takes 10 Watt-hours to fully charge."
    }
}

The fields are:
- obj: a name for the object. No spaces.
- val: how much kWh this object requires. Append "MULTIPLY-" at the
front of the name for multiplicative operations (e.g. km driven by a
train requires multiplying total kWh, compared to phone batteries
charged, which requires dividing the total kWh)
- bg: the background for the slider.
 Backgrounds have dimensions of 360px x 160px.
 Specify the background using a string "url('img/your-img-here.png')"
- color: the color for the text that appears in that slide.
- lText.margin: holds the top and left margins.
 Specify in terms of pixels.
 Specify "null" for the default margin.
- rText.margin: holds the top and right margins.
- rText.up: holds the text above the number
- rText.span: holds the text after the number
- rText.down: holds the text below the number
 Use "" to not specify any of these texts.
- tooltip: holds the text that appears on hovering over the slider.



INDEX.HTML

In the style tag, under the body selector, you can change the background
image and the background color.
 The color is displayed if the background doesn't load.
 The background itself is being taken from the schoolgen website.
 You can replace the background attribute with 'background-color: <color-hexcode-here>'
